# hello-world
Once upon a time, a girl wanted to learn react,
She wanted to do it the right way, and keen to be exact,
Didn't know where to start, she's always just hacked,
Went to a tutorial, and got sent to install webpack.

So she's here because there are more things she needs to know,
Things to learn and configure before she can clone this repo,
Wish her luck because she's now playing around on github,
Designer at heart, but today she joins the dev club.
